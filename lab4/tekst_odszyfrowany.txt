Cryptography is both an art and a science that protects information by transforming it into secure formats. Modern encryption techniques rely on complex algorithms and mathematical principles to ensure data confidentiality. The development of stream ciphers marked significant progress in symmetric cryptography, with LFSR-based systems playing important historical role. While this example uses simplified approach, real-world applications require more sophisticated methods to withstand cryptanalysis. Testing encryption systems with varied input texts helps verify their robustness against different attack vectors.
